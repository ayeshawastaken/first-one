# IntroCompSciWork

My first repository, one that I am using to store code written in an Introduction to Computer Science Course.

The folder PreAssignment1Work contains several exercises relating to basic Python concepts, which were used to prepare for Assignment 1. Assignment 1, in the Assigments folder, was used to test a basic understanding of such concepts. 

The next folder, PreAssignment2Work is similar to the previous exercise folder. 

Also forgive me if anything in it is dumb or pointless; I'm trying my best to figure everything out right now.
